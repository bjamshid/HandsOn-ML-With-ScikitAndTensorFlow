1. How would you define Machine Learning?

    Machine Learning is the ability of a machine to detect patterns from data and use the pattern to make prediction for new data.

2. Can you name 4 types of problems where it shines?
    - problems that their solution require a lot of rules
    - problems that don't have an apparent solution which need more insight 
    - problems with changing environment factors
    - problems that cant be solved with traditional approaches (image recognition)
3. what is a labeled training set?

    A labeled training set is a data set that has tags for its features.

4. What are the 2 most common supervised tasks?
    - classification
    - regression

5. Name 4 common unsupervised tasks?
    - under clustering category (grouping instances of data based on inherent relations):
        segmenting based on characteristics and categorizing based on metrics
    - under association category (infer rules in data):
        frequent item-set and rules generation
    - visualization
    - dimensionality reduction

6. what type of machine learning algorithm is used to allow a robot to walk in various unknown terrains?
    - reinforcement learning

7. what type of machine learning algorithm is used to segment customers into multiple groups?
    - clustering

8. is spam detection framed as supervised learning or unsupervised learning?
    - supervised

9. what is an online learning system?
    
    system is trained sequentially and can adapt to new data (learning rate)
10. what is out-of-core learning?
    system learns from data (that doesnt fit into its memory) by chopping it into smaller chunks and using online learning
    to learn from those chunks

11. what type of learning algorithm relies on a similarity measure to make predictions?
    - instance based learning

12. difference between model parameter and learning algorithms hyper-parameter?
    model parameters determine what system will predict given new data, whereas hyper-parameter is a parameter of the learning algorithm itself 
    (not of the model).

13. what do model based algorithms search for?
        optimal value as prediction for given data
    what is the most common strategy they use to succeed?
    how do they make predictions?
